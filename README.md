# TDL_2020_music_generation
Single instrument music generation using two models -> 1) Restricted Boltzmann machine and 2) Stacked LSTM model
<br>
The dataset used is stored in PES1201701295_data which contains a list of .mid files. You may choose any number of .mid files and place it in the required location.
<br>
To run the project with both the models-> python3 PES1201701295_source/main.py
<br>
To run required models only look into PES1201701295_source/Model_1.py and PES1201701295_source/Model_2.py
